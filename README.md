JD-sample-libraries
===================

Dirt-simple sample libraries for EECE 387. These libraries are intended to be minimalist samples-- they don't take advantage of more complex hardware features such as interrupt synchronization.


Libraries
-----------

- A <i>Two Wire Interface ("I2C") master</i> library, which allows simple control of an I2C device using a bus-pirate-like syntax.
- A <i>uart-over-stdio</i> library, which is conveneint for simple serial monitors.
